# honeypot

simple honeypot I made for fun

you can use `make` and `make install` to install it

run `honeypot` after installation, this listens to every port within the range of 1-1023 and prints out the data that is sent to the server

binary data is funky and sometimes clears the screen, this is a very simple script currently and I'll improve it later
